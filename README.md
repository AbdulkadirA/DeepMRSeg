[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/abb2c20d73ed464180494bf2fed3f0eb)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/CBICA/DeepMRSeg?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=CBICA/DeepMRSeg&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

DeepMRSeg is a Python-based package for processing and analysis of MRI images. The package is developed and maintained by the [Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA)](https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. As the name implies, main modules of DeepMRSeg are built upon Deep Learning models that perform a set of image segmentation steps on initial scans.

DeepMRSeg aims to provide users a ***robust*** and ***accurate*** toolset for performing common image processing tasks in neuroimaging. In order to be able to meet these challenges DeepMRSeg uses a modified UNet architecture that combines an ensemble of learners. A second major feature of DeepMRSeg is the set of pre-trained models provided for various tasks. Importantly, we applied intensive model training using very large and diverse MRI datasets with carefully verified ground-truth labels.
